# Using Machine Learning to Improve Streaming Quality at Netflix

- Viewing/browsing behavior on mobile devices is different than on Smart TVs
- Cellular networks may be more volatile and unstable than fixed broadband networks
- networks in some markets may experience higher degrees of congestion
- Different device groups have different capabilities and fidelities of internet connection due to hardware differences

## Network quality characterization and prediction

- Can we predict what throughput will look like in the next 15 minutes given the last 15 minutes of data?
- temporal pattern recognition with various contextual indicators to make more accurate predictions of network quality

## Video quality adaptation during playback

- quality of experience
  - the initial amount of time spent waiting for video to play
  - the overall video quality experienced by the user
  - the number of times playback paused to load more video into the buffer
  - the amount of perceptible fluctuation in quality during playback

## Predictive caching

- prediting what a user will play in order to cache part of it on the device before the user hits play

## Device anomaly detection
