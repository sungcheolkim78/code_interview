# A 4-step process for effective system design interviews

## Step 1: Understand the problem and establish design scope

- In a system design interview, giving out an answer quickly without thinking gives you no bonus points.
- So, do not jump right in to give a solution. Slow down. Think deeply and ask questions to clarify requirements and assumptions. This is extremely important.
- 1) ask the right questions 2) make the proper assumptions 3) gather all the information needed to build a system

Questions to understand the exact requirements:

- what specific features are we going to build?
- how many users does the product have?
- how fast does the company anticipate to scale up?
- what is the company's technology stack?

## Step 2: Propose high-level design and get buy-in

- Come up with an initial blueprint for the design. Ask for feedback.
- Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper.
- Do back-of-the-envelope calculations to evaluate if your blueprint fits the scale constraints.

## Step 3: Design deep dive

- Agreed on the overall goals and feature scope
- Sketched out a high-level blueprint for the overall design
- Obtained feedback from your interviewer on the high-level design
- Had some initial ideas about areas to focus on in deep dive based on her feedback

## Step 4: Wrap up

- The interviewer might want you to identify the system bottlenecks and discuss potential improvements.
- It could be useful to give the interviewer a recap of your design.
- Error cases (server failure, network loss, etc.) are interesting to talk about.
- Operation issues are worth mentioning.
- How to handle the next scale curve is also an interesting topic.

Dos

- Always ask for clarification. Do not assume your assumption is correct.
- Understand the requirements of the problem.
-  There is neither the right answer nor the best answer. A solution designed to solve the problems of a young startup is different from that of an established company with millions of users. Make sure you understand the requirements.
-  Let the interviewer know what you are thinking. Communicate with your interview.
-  Suggest multiple approaches if possible.
-  Once you agree with your interviewer on the blueprint, go into details on each component. Design the most critical components first.
-  Bounce ideas off the interviewer. A good interviewer works with you as a teammate.
-  Never give up.

Don’ts

- Don't be unprepared for typical interview questions.
- Don’t jump into a solution without clarifying the requirements and assumptions.
- Don’t go into too much detail on a single component in the beginning. Give the high-level design first then drills down.
- If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for hints.
- Again, communicate. Don't think in silence.
- Don’t think your interview is done once you give the design. You are not done until your interviewer says you are done. Ask for feedback early and often.

## Time allocation on each step

- Step 1 Understand the problem and establish design scope: 3-10 minutes
- Step 2 Propose high-level design and get buy-in: 10-15 minutes
- Step 3 Design deep dive: 10-25 minutes
- Step 4 Wrap up: 3-5 minutes
